# A/B Test Design: Optimizing Payment Method Order for Increased Sales
### Overview
This project involves designing an A/B test to optimize the order of payment methods on an e-commerce platform, with the goal of increasing total sales. By testing different payment method sequences, we aim to gain insights into how user behavior is influenced by the order in which payment options are presented, ultimately improving conversion rates and customer experience.

### Objective
-**Primary Goal:** Maximize total sales by optimizing the order of payment methods.

-**Secondary Goals:** Reduce cart abandonment rates, increase average order value (AOV), and improve customer retention.

### Hypothesis
-**Null Hypothesis (H0):** Changing the payment method order has no significant impact on total sales.

-**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Changing the payment method order significantly affects total sales.

Methodology
1. Identifying Variants
Different payment methods are presented in varied orders for testing.
Variants with high potential impact were chosen for the A/B test.
2. Sample Size Calculation
The required sample size was determined based on desired statistical significance and effect size.
3. Random Assignment
Users were randomly assigned to different payment method order variations to eliminate bias.
4. Test Duration
The duration of the test was calculated based on website traffic and expected user interactions with the payment options.
Data Collection & Analysis
1. Data Collection
Data on user behavior, interactions, and outcomes during the test was tracked and collected for analysis.
2. Consistency in Data
Ensured that data collected across all variants was consistent and accurate to avoid incorrect conclusions.
3. Statistical Analysis
A hypothesis test was performed to check for significant differences in total sales between the control and test groups.
Metrics
Key metrics analyzed during the test included:

Total sales
Conversion rates
Cart abandonment rates
Average order value (AOV)
Customer retention and lifetime value
Compliance
The A/B test adhered to:

PCI DSS Compliance: Ensuring secure credit card processing.
GDPR and Data Privacy: Protecting customer data as per regulations.
Third-Party Terms: Compliance with payment provider terms.
Post-Campaign Analysis
Once the A/B test was complete, a post-campaign analysis was conducted to assess the impact of the changes:

Total Sales and Conversion Rates: Measured to compare performance with the control group.
User Behavior Analysis: Customer actions such as cart abandonment and payment method engagement were analyzed.
Cost-Benefit Analysis: Financial implications were considered to evaluate the feasibility of implementing changes.
Customer Satisfaction: Feedback was collected on user experience with the payment methods.
Removal of "NextPay" Payment Option
A separate analysis was conducted regarding the potential impact of removing the "NextPay" payment option:

Risks: Removal could lead to lower conversion rates and customer dissatisfaction.
Benefit: Reduced financial risk from credit options.
A/B Testing: An A/B test was performed to evaluate the effects of removing NextPay for users who rely on this payment method.
